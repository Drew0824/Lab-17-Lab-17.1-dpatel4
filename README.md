# Intro to value returning methods
## Step 1
Add comments to explain what the output from this program will be and how you know. Describe in detail how the program operates to produce the result.

## Step 2
Adapt the code from one of the functions above to create a new function called 'multiplier'.
  
The user should be able to input two numbers that are stored in the multiplier function's local variables (num1 and num2). 
  
The function should multiply the two variables together and return the result to a variable in the main method (where it is called).
  
The main function should then ouput the variable containing the result returned from the multiply function.

_Sample console output:_
```
Enter a number: 5
Enter another number: 4
20
```
